## Typescript NodeJs with Jest project starter template

This is a simple template to get you started on any typescript Node js project. In addition to setting up the typescript env, I also added configuration for jest. 

# Getting started
You can simply install this from npm package by running the following command
```
npm install typescript-node-jest-starter
```

# Commands
The following are some of the pre-configured commands to get you started.
